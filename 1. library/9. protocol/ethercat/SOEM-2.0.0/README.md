SOEM (Simple Open EtherCAT Master) is a software library for
developing EtherCAT MainDevices.

This library is specifically designed for real-time communication in
embedded systems. Its lightweight architecture minimizes resource
consumption, making it suitable for environments with limited
resources. SOEM can also be utilized on both Linux and Windows
systems.

As a library rather than a standalone application, SOEM provides
flexibility and customization for developers looking to implement
EtherCAT technology.
