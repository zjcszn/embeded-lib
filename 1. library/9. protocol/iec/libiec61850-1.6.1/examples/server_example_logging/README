BUILD THE EXAMPLE:

To build the logging example it is required to have sqlite present!

If you have sqlite installed on the system (including the header files) e.g. in an Ubuntu installation with the sqlite3 package installed, you can simply use the Makefile.

If you don't have sqlite installed you have to download the sqlite amalgamation package and install the files sqlite3.c, sqlite3.h in the libiec61850/third_party/sqlite folder and use the Makefile.sqliteStatic instead. This will build a version of the example with the sqlite code statically linked.
